And maybe even a third one: I stumbled across an approach to use
Curve25519 keypairs for both ECDH and Ed25519 signatures
[https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2014/000293.html].

Would that be feasible also for Taler? Since Taler (afaik) relies on
some GNUnet mechanisms, it seems preferable not to introduce YACS (Yet
Another Crypto Scheme)...
