@subsection TRANSPORT

The TRANSPORT service handles all message exchanges between a local peer and
other peers on the network. It can -- depending on the computer hardware it
is running on -- support multiple transport methods between peers: TCP/IP,
UDP/IP, ICMP, HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi and others.

Each transport method has its unique way of specifying a peer address; TCP/IP
expects an IP address and a port number, while HTTP expects an URL. So a
single peer can have multiple addresses (one for each available transport
method). CORE links all these addresses to one peer identity. While a peer
address can (and often do) change over time, the peer identity is fixed.

The TRANSPORT service establishes, maintains, processes and drops connections
with other peers on request of the CORE service. If a new connection to a peer
identity is requested, the ATS (Automatic Transport Selection) decides which
available transport method should be used. To improve performance and
reliability, multiple channels on different transport methods can be created
between two peers at the same time; the sender sends the next message on the
channel with the best throughput.

Connection requests from other peers can be filtered by the TRANSPORT service
(e.g. by implementing a black-list of banned peers), all other requests are
forwarded to the CORE service for validation and approval.
